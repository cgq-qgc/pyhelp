Welcome to PyHelp's documentation!
==================================

PyHelp is an object oriented Python library that provides a set of tools to
evaluate spatially distributed groundwater recharge at the regional scale
using the `HELP`_ model.
This work is based on the method that was originally developed by
`Croteau et al. (2011)`_ to assess spatially distributed groundwater recharge
in the Chateauguay River Watershed, Quebec, Canada.

If you encounter any problems or errors during program execution,
have any questions, or have suggestions on how to improve PyHelp,
please contact Jean-SÃ©bastien Gosselin at jean-sebastien.gosselin@ete.inrs.ca.
