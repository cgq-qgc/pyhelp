    "PyHELP is an object oriented Python library providing a set of tools "
    "to estimate spatially distributed groundwater recharge and other "
    "hydrological components (runoff and evapotranspiration) using "
    "the HELP ([Hydrologic Evaluation of Landfill Performance]({})) model."
    "PyHELP integrates weather data (from grids or stations), "
    "land conditions defined by a series of GIS maps as well as soil "
    "and geological material properties into HELP input files. "
    "PyHELP also processes HELP simulation results and outputs them as "
    "maps and graphs, including comparisons of simulation results with "
    "stream hydrographs. PyHELP thus accompanies users through the entire "
    "workflow from input file assembly to model calibration and to the "
    "documentation of results. This workflow is based on the method "
    "originally developed by [Croteau et al. (2011)]({}) to assess spatially "
    "distributed groundwater recharge at the regional scale."
