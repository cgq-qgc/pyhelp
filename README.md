# Install

If you are new to Python or the Scientific Python ecosystem, we strongly recommend you to install and use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) (miniconda is fine as well). It comes with the most important Python scientific libraries (i.e. Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, IPython, etc), including all PyHELP dependencies, in a single, easy to use environment. We also support [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/), but please be aware that pip installations are for advanced users. PyHELP depends on several low-level libraries for geospatial analysis, and this may cause dependency conflicts if you are not careful.
